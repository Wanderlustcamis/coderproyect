				<p class="overflow-auto">I have been very passionate about photography from a young age. When I was a kid, I was lucky enough to get a Barbie camera (with real Kodak film!) as a birthday present… And that’s when it all started. Then in my pre-teenage years, my aunt lent me her Kodak Tele-Ektralite. Technology was changing and when I was able to buy my own camera, I got myself a Kodak Easyshare DC3400. It was my first digital camera and I used it until the battery compartment cracked and I could no longer hold it together with tape. By then I was about to turn 18 and my grandparents gave me a Kodak Easyshare Z710 for my birthday. Tragically, this camera got stolen at a party. Let’s just say I was young and reckless... Anyway, it was a blow and it dashed my hopes of furthering my dream of pursuing a career in photography. At least that’s how it seemed back then. So, in my early twenties, I embarked on my other great passion in life: traveling the world. I found myself in need of a new camera to capture some memories and record my experiences. Since I still despaired of ever becoming a photographer, I opted for a basic camera: a CoolPix P520. It turned out that this mix—traveling and a camera—was the push I needed to seriously pursue photography, and it put me behind the lens for life. I made the decision of buying a real camera. I am now using a Nikon D5200, which I still think is appropriate for my work, using the right lenses. I started take photography classes—all kind of classes: from the history of photography and how to use all sorts of cameras properly to distinguishing between different types of flashes (studio and non-studio), learning different lighting methods, composition, how to edit and develop, how to put together my own portfolio, etc. I took classes in two different institutes in my hometown and also complemented what I learned there with some online training. Now I have been taking pictures for over 15 years and I love it so much I want to share with others what I capture with my camera. On this page, you will find a collection of my work. Hope you enjoy looking through my photographs as much as I did working on them.
