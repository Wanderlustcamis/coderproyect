				<p>I was very passionate about photography from a young age. I was lucky enough to get a Barbie camera, with real Kodak film, as a birthday present when I was a kid….and it all started.
		As a pre teen my aunt lend me her Kodak Tele-Ektralite and as tecnology was changing I later got myself a Kodak Easyshare DC3400, my first digital camera which I used until the battery compartment broke down and I could not hold it with tape anymore.
		By then I was about to turn 18 and my grandparents gave me a Kodak Easyshare Z710 for my birthday. This camera got tragically stolen because of young stupidity, and left me with zero hope of getting anywhere as a photographer.
		When I reached my 20s I started doing one of my main plans for my life, traveling the world. So I found myself in the need of a new camera to capture some memories. Since I still was hopeless, I got a basic one at the moment. a CoolPix 520.
		This mix gave me the push i needed to pursuit a carrier in photography. And took the decision  of getting a real camera.
		I am now using a Nikon D5200, which i still think is appropriate for my work using the right lenses. But with this purchase also came along photography classes, all kind. its history, how to use any camera properly, different type of flashes, studio a no studio ones, different lighting methods, composition, how to edit and develop, how to make my own portfolio etc.
		All in two different institutes and also reinforced with some online training.
		I’ve been taking pictures for over 15 years and enjoy it so much I would love to share what I capture with other people.
		So here, on this page, you will find a collection of my work.
		Hope you enjoy as much as I did working on them!
